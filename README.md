# HackX_3_Syntax_Syndicate
Official Repo for HackX 3.0 

**Future-Ready Hiring and Assessment Platform**
Team: Syntax Syndicate | MUJ HackX 3.0

**Overview:**
A next-gen hiring and assessment platform that integrates AI fairly within tests. Candidates can use AI under controlled limits — encouraging reasoning, adaptability, and creativity instead of rote memorization.

**Problem:**
AI misuse makes traditional assessments unreliable. Current systems don’t measure how candidates think — only what they answer.

**Solution:**
1. Allow AI usage inside the test but control it with:
2. Prompt and time limits
3. Anti-copy features
4. Prompt history tracking
5. Scoring based on reasoning and efficiency

**Core Features:**
1. Tests for system design, DSA, cloud concepts, and architecture
2. Built-in AI panel with monitored prompts
3. Dashboard with leaderboards, efficiency scores, and individual insights
4. SQL-based fair scoring system

**Tech Stack:**
React, Tailwind CSS, FastAPI, Llama 3, DeepSeek, Shivaay AI

**Vision:**
To redefine skill evaluation — where AI is a learning tool, not a shortcut.
