Official Repo for HackX 3.0 

Future-Ready Hiring and Assessment Platform
Team: Syntax Syndicate | MUJ HackX 3.0

Overview:
A next-gen hiring and assessment platform that integrates AI fairly within tests. Candidates can use AI under controlled limits — encouraging reasoning, adaptability, and creativity instead of rote memorization.

Problem:
AI misuse makes traditional assessments unreliable. Current systems don’t measure how candidates think — only what they answer.

Solution:
Allow AI usage inside the test but control it with:

Prompt and time limits

Anti-copy features

Prompt history tracking

Scoring based on reasoning and efficiency

Core Features:

Tests for system design, DSA, cloud concepts, and architecture

Built-in AI panel with monitored prompts

Dashboard with leaderboards, efficiency scores, and individual insights

SQL-based fair scoring system

Tech Stack:
React, Tailwind CSS, FastAPI, Llama 3, DeepSeek, Shivaay AI

Impact:

Promotes fair AI use

Evaluates real thinking and creativity

Scalable for universities, companies, and hackathons

Vision:
To redefine skill evaluation — where AI is a learning tool, not a shortcut.
